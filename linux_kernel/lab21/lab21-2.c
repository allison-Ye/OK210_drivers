/*
 * Examining and modifying process priorities with getpriority(),
 * setpriority().
 *
 * Despite their names, the getpriority() and setpriority() functions
 * actually change the  nice values (see man 2 nice) for a process,
 * process group, or user, which are then used to get and set the
 * scheduling priorities in the scheduling algorithm.
 *
 * After examining the man pages for these
 * functions, write a program that can examine and tries to modify the
 * priority of a process.  (This is essentially an implementation of the
 * nice command line utility.)
 *
 * By default it should work with the current process; an optional
 * argument should be the process ID of another running process (You can
 * just run cat&amp; in the background if you want to be careful).
 *
 * You may want to loop over possible values, from
 * -20 to +19.
 *
 * You should find that only root users can use
 * setpriority() to obtain an advantage in scheduling;
 * normal users can only lower their process priorities.
